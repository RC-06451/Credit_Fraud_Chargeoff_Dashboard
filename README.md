# Credit_Fraud_Chargeoff_Dashboard
As my project is for a consulting client, I had to use simulated data for this public financial dashboard.  I created a couple of similated data csv files on github for two groups: 

(1) the non paying or fraudulent customer (NP) who is approved for a credit card based on income and credit score, maxes out    the card and then never makes a single payment and 
(2) the month six delinquent customer (M6) who has made at least one single credit card payment but at some point becomes delinquent for six months running. At the six month mark, this customer is charged off the company's books.
